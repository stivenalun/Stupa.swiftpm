#Stupa 
Hi ðŸ‘‹! I am Stiven from Batam, Indonesia. I am a Learner who started learning iOS App Development at Apple Developer Academy @Infinite Learning Batam.

##About This App
Indonesia is one of the countries that has many Buddhist temples. Most of them are located on the Java Island, but there are also temples outside of Java Island. When I asked my Buddhist friend named Lisa about the Muara Takus temple located in Riau, she answered that she didn't know. This is understandable because temples outside of Java Island are less covered by the media, and this is unfortunate because temples are sacred places for Buddhists that can be used for worship and celebrating religious holidays such as Tri Suci Waisak. In addition, each parts structure of the temple has a meaning that symbolizes the teachings of Buddha. 

Stupa is an application designed to help introduce Buddhist temples outside of Java. Stupa has two main features. The first is learning with flashcards to know the location and characteristics of Buddhist temples outside of Java. The second feature is to invite user to get to know the structure of the temple by playing a game of draging temple parts structure into a complete temple, and we will also know the meaning of each part structure of the temple in the Buddhist religion.


Let's learn & play together ðŸ˜†
